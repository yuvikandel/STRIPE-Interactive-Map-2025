        <h2 class="h2font_2">Roseate Spoonbill Migration + Facts</h2>
        <p class="pink_font">Roseate Spoonbills are usually found in the Southeastern coast of the US and around Central
            to South America. Most spoonbills migrate short distances often due to changes in food and water levels.
            They are pale, pink birds and the end of their bill flattens into a spoon-like shape, hence the name
            spoonbill.</p>
        <img class="center_img" src="Roseate_Spoonbill.webp" height="90px" alt="bird">
        <p class="pink_font">Challenges faced during migration: Habitat loss, climate change, and predators</p>
        <img class="center_img" src="SpoonbillLocal.jpeg" height="90px" alt="birdfeeding">
        <p class="pink_font">Fun Fact: This picture was taken by our very own Coach Tania right infront of her house, at
            Lake Lynn, Raleigh NC!</p>

        <h2 class="h2font_3">Invasive Species</h2>
        <p class="blue_font">The Mayan Cichlid is an invasive species that disrupts the balance of the ecosystem that spoonbills migrate to and from. They consume most of the resources in the rivers, and often compete with the spoonbill for food.</p>
        <img class="center_img" src="fishgroup1.png" height="90px" alt="invasivefish">
        <p class="blue_font">They are known to travel in groups, which is why they cause so much trouble for the birds.</p>
        <img class="center_img" src="fishgroup2.png" height="90px" alt="invasivefish">
        <p class="blue_font"><br>It's pronounced "sick-lid" for those of you who didn't know ;)</p>

        <h2 class="h2font_2">Dolphin Migration + Facts</h2>
        <p class="pink_font">During the dry season, the Amazon River dolphins occupy the main river channels in the
            Amazon. During the rainy season, they migrate to smaller tributaries in the forest and floodplains.</p>
        <img class="center_img" src="pinkdolphin_card.jpg" height="90px" alt="dolphin">
        <p class="pink_font">Challenges faced during migration: Habitat loss, pollution/litter in the ocean,
            entanglement in fishing gear, and human activities</p>
        <img class="center_img" src="pinkdolphineating.jpg" height="90px" alt="dolphinkiller">
        <p class="pink_font">Fun Fact: Some of the fish species that are commonly consumed by pink river dolphins
            include piranhas (yikes!), catfish, characins, and tetras.</p>

        <button class="cardButton" id="dolphinButton" onclick="hideElement('dcCard')">X</button>
        <h2 class="h2font_3">Pollution</h2>
        <p class="blue_font">When the pink dolphin is migrating through the amazon rivers, they often encounter lots of pollution such as plastic bottles, waste water, sewage, and etc. If the pollution gets into their system, they often face struggles with breathing, harm to their immune system, and disruptions in their population and environment.</p>
        <img class="center_img" src="p1.png" height="90px" alt="pollution.jpg">
        <p class="blue_font"> It also greatly increases the risk of diseases such as cancer.

        <h2 class="h2font_2">Zebra Migration + Facts</h2>
        <p class="pink_font">Zebras migrate to Botswana, the Makgadikgadi, and the Serengeti National Park. They travel
            in the rainy seasons and go around 2,900 miles, occupying many geographical areas.</p>
        <img class="center_img" src="zebracardpic.jpg" height="90px" alt="zebra">
        <p class="pink_font">Zebras face many challenges on their journey of migration:
            <br>1. Predators:<br>- Hyenas<br>- Cheetahs + Leopards<br>- Crocodiles<br>2. Lack of water<br>3.
            Navigating obstacles such as human activities

        <img class="center_img" src="ZebraLogo.png" height="50px" alt="zebralogo">
        <p class="pink_font">Fun Fact: Zebras' stripes create tiny air currents that help cool them down, like natural air-conditioning!</p>

        <h2 class="h2font_3">Lions</h2>
        <p class="blue_font">When Zebra's migrate to Botswana, they encounter the "King of the Safari", the Lion. The average Lion kills about 62 zebras per year. Espcally during Zebra migration, they are under threat of the lion. </p>
        <img class="center_img" src="lion1.png" height="90px" alt="lion1">
        <p class="blue_font">Zebras must always stay silent, as lions often rely on teamwork and stealth to hunt. Although zebras are fast runners, they must stay alert, as they are vulnerable towards the lions. Under the constant presence of lions, zebras must stay cautious, as lions are usually their biggest challenge.</p>
        <img class="center_img" src="lion2.png" height="90px" alt="lion2">
        <p class="blue_font">Simba is the Swahili word for lion. It means "king" :)</p>
